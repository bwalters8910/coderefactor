## Description
A "marketing agency" has hired me to comb through their site to make it more accessible.  I added semantic HTML elements, made sure the elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, added accessibility alt attributes to images, and fixed the "search engine optimization" link. After completing this project I learned that coding takes a lot of practice, and changing divs can be more complicated than I iniatially thought. Required some trial and error.
